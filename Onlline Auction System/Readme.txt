Author: Sirapanasetty Bhargav
Student ID: VU21CSEN0102119
Overview
The Online Auction System is a console-based application developed in Python that allows users to participate in auctions by registering, creating auction listings, and placing bids. This project aims to provide a secure and efficient platform for users to conduct auctions from the comfort of their homes, thereby saving time and resources typically spent on physical auctions.
Features
User Registration: Users can register with a unique username.
Create Auction: Users can create auctions by specifying the item name.
Place Bids: Users can place bids on existing auctions.
View Auctions: Users can view all current auctions, including the highest bid and all bids placed.
Console-Based Interaction: The application runs entirely in the console, providing a straightforward user experience.
Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Data Structure: Lists and dictionaries for managing users and auctions
Development Environment: Any Python IDE or text editor
Installation
Ensure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download it from python.org.
Copy the provided code into a file named auction_system.py.
Open your terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory where the file is saved.
Run the application using the command:
bash
python auction_system.py

Usage
Upon running the program, you will see a menu with the following options:
Register User
Create Auction
Place Bid
View Auctions
Exit
Follow the prompts to interact with the system. You can register as a user, create auctions, place bids, and view ongoing auctions.
Output Expectations
The output of the program will be displayed in the console. Users will see messages confirming their actions, such as successful registration, auction creation, and bid placements. The current state of auctions, including the highest bids, will also be displayed.
Screenshots
Include screenshots of the console output demonstrating key functionalities such as user registration, auction creation, and bid placements.
Conclusion
The Online Auction System provides a foundational framework for conducting auctions online. It can be further enhanced by adding features such as user authentication, auction time limits, and improved bid management. This project serves as a practical demonstration of using Python for building console applications that facilitate user interactions in a bidding environment.
